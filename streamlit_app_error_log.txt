Error Traceback:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Traceback:
File "/mount/src/ollama/app.py", line 2, in <module>
    import openai
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Root Cause:
- The module `openai` is not installed in the environment.

Recommended Fix:
1. Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file with this line:
   openai

2. Re-deploy your app to Streamlit Cloud.
   - Streamlit will auto-install packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. If using `pyproject.toml`, make sure `openai` is added as a dependency.

Additional Notes:
- Ensure your `requirements.txt` also includes other dependencies like `streamlit`, `langchain`, or others if used.
- You can test locally using:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Status: ❌ App crashed due to missing dependency
